      <h1>The VPS shat itself again, so project <strong>temp0ral.world</strong> will be on hiatus.</h1>
      <p>Yeah so I can't really be bothered to look for another cheap hosting provider to then maintain an instance of my vision for a new system of microblogging/kareha and my work life. I'm releasing the codebase under AGPL for all to 
        see and tinker with. Hell, run your own instance if you so fancy. Modify and improve the code to your liking. Maybe one day I'll revisit this project with a bigger and better vision.</p>
